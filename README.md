All new code for a classic pinball machine. With an Arduino connected to the MPU, this code will run on a Silverball Mania pinball machine (1980).  
  
## How to build this for your machine  
1) build or buy a board to interface an Arduino MEGA 2560 PRO with the MPU processor socket or J5 connector  
2) get this code, put it in a SBM23 folder  
3) update configuration in RPU_config.h to match your board type  
4) compile/install code on the Arduino MEGA 2560 PRO
